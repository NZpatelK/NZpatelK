##Hi there 👋

I'm excited to share a bit about myself with you! I recently graduated from Auckland University of Technology, where I studied a Bachelor of Computer and Information Science in software development. Basically, I'm a coding wizard 🧙‍♂️

My passion lies in full-stack development, website development, and mobile application development. I love being creative and innovative when building applications - it's like solving a puzzle that no one else has solved before! 🤓

When I'm not busy coding, you can usually find me in the kitchen whipping up a delicious meal or exploring new recipes. Cooking is one of my favorite hobbies, and I love trying new cuisines and experimenting with different flavors - it's like a fun science experiment! 🍳🧪

Aside from cooking, I'm also passionate about learning new soft skills that can help me grow both personally and professionally. Whether it's working on my communication skills or learning how to be a better team player, I'm always looking for ways to improve. 💼📈

In my spare time, I enjoy creating content on LinkedIn to share my knowledge and experiences with others. I love being a part of the community and helping others learn and grow in their careers. Whether it's writing articles or creating videos, there's something special about being a content creator! 🎥📝

One thing that definitely fuels my creativity is watching movies and TV series. And when it comes to superhero movies, Marvel is where it's at! Who else is a fan of Iron Man, Captain America, and the rest of the Avengers? 🦸‍♂️🦸‍♀️

Another thing that brings me joy is hiking in the mountains. The fresh air, the stunning views, and the peace and quiet all combine to make it a truly magical experience. New Zealand has some of the most breathtaking mountains in the world, and I feel so lucky to be able to explore them! ⛰️

And finally, my biggest goal in life is to travel the world! There are so many amazing cultures and experiences out there, and I can't wait to see and learn as much as possible. 🌎

Thanks for taking the time to get to know me a bit better. Let's go out and have some fun! 🤩

#### Feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn to explore potential collaborations and expand our professional network 👥
